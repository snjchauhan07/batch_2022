<p style=" font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-style: oblique;"> This festival is celebrated all over India
by the Hindu majority. The people called this festival by different names like Krishna Janmashtami,
Sree Jayanti, Gokilashtami, and Srikrishna Jayanti. The birth of Lord Krishna took place to
dispel evil from the earth and spread the message of love and brotherhood.
Lord Krishna was the eights child of the Devaki and Vasudeva and he proved the prophecy 
to kill Kind Kansa. However, King Kansatried many times to kill Bal Krishna 
when he was very small but every time his efforts were in vain.</p>

<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-style: oblique;">The Krishna Janmashtami is a very
important festival for all the Hindus and they also keep fast on the same day. 
The devotees break their fast on the next day after midnight.
Also, they worship Lord Krishna by singing songs and aarti or Lord Vishnu and Krishna.

many Hindu temples are decorated with lights and flowers. A host of bhajans and kirtans

Even the schools celebrate this auspicious festival by dressing the 
small children in Lord Krishna dress and dance performances take place</p>

this festival is Dahi Handi that takes place on the day of Krishna Janmashtami.
In the childhood, Lord Krishna was named as Makhan Chor and that’s why this event takes
place on every Krishna Janmashtami in which Dahi Handi is hung on the rope at a certain
height and a person has to put a hole 
in that Handi by creating a group of people and climbing over them.</p>

<div id="overflowTest">Once while walking on the banks of Yamuna,
a Gopi saw a pair of foot prints near a tree. Seeing that , 
she started imagining: ‘These must be the foot prints of lord Krishna. 
he must have come this way and a Gopi must have asked him to fetch her some flowers from the tree.
Since the flowering branch of the tree is above the normal reach of the hand, Krishna 
must have gripped the shoulders of the Gopi and jumped up to fetch some flowers. 
When he landed with a thud, his foot prints must have got imprinted like this in the sand’.
She immediately called up severala Gopis and said to them:
“See here! These are the foot prints of our lord krishna!”
All Gopis gathered excitedly around the foot print. 
The Gopi who imagined  so got deeply immersed in the thoughts of lord Krishna. 
All other Gopis surrounding her suddenly appeared to her as various manifestations of  Krishna
When one of the Gopis touched her shoulders, she felt as though Krishna was 
touching her shoulders and the very thought made her swoon. The rest of the Gopis 
too were swept by thoughts of Krishna. Shedding tears, they all lost their outer consciousness.
It is such a mindset that we should develop to attain God. We must see everything as God.“Dear God,
Kindly bless that the Gopis and Gopas of Brindavan always have this guileless love for God;
let rains come neither in excess nor in shortage; let their cows and bulls prosper; 
let them get cow milk in abundance; let cereals, fruits and vegetables grow enough 
to feed all of them sumptuously…”. The priest was wonderstruck at the little boy’s sincere prayers.
After a while, a large gathering of Gopis and Gopas of Vrindavan too came to the temple
and the priest heard a chorus of prayers: “Dear Lord, on this birth day of Krishna,
we pray to you to give him all the prosperity, joy and good health; let him not face
any threat from the demons and rakshasas and please protect him from such evil doers; 
please let us behave in such a way that we remain the recipients of his love always…”</div>

<center><img src="p27.jpg"alt="image" width="50%" height="50%" margin-right:15px></center>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-style: oblique;">Lord Krishna is said to have 
108 names among which the famous ones are Gopal, Govind, Devakinandan, 
Mohan, Shyam, Ghanshyam, Hari, Girdhari, Baanke Bihari to name a few. The Kurukshetra war 
left all 100 of Gandhari's sons dead. When Krishna approached her to pay his condolences,
the grieving mother spitefully cursed him that he along with the Yadu dynasty would perish in 36 years.
Krishna already felt that the Yadavas were already transforming into a morally decadent race 
and should perish and so he calmly said "Tathastu" (So be it) at the end of her declaration.
Krishna's good looks are the matter of folklore, but though commonly depicted in paintings and 
idols as blue, his skin colour was actually dark. Spiritualists believe that his all-inclusive,magnetic 
aura had blue hues and so he is generally depicted as being blue in colour.Kunti, the mother of the
Pandavas was actually Vasudev's sister. Vasudev was Krishna's father.</p>
